// Adapted for SquirrelPad from ConkerBFDReloaded v1.3.1,
// commit 90a014dbac5019c20a1b7a820ea16a1f0553052f. See LICENSE.txt and THIRD_PARTY_LICENSE.txt.
// Ledge Grab (Accessibility tab): when Conker walks off anything high (not a step), he catches the
// edge and hangs on, as he does on the barn's beams and some wooden platforms; and coming down from
// a jump just short of an edge, he catches it instead of falling back.
//
// The game already has the move. Falling, its movement step asks the collision for an edge to
// grab (func_15044380's second pass, func_150AC3E4), and if one is found func_1504CB98 turns Conker
// to it, hangs him from it (animation 0x42) and lets him climb up or drop. But the search only
// looks at ground triangles marked as grabbable (their flags, D_800DBE5C, with all of 0x0E000000
// set: the mask func_150AC3E4 passes the shared triangle walk at 0x150AC474). With the option on,
// when Conker has just walked off a real drop or comes down from a jump, the mask is cleared so
// every ground edge counts; everything else (where he hangs, the animations, climbing up,
// dropping) is the game's own.
//
// The search only takes an edge within 21 units of him (D_8009F6FC = 21 squared) once it's at his
// hands' height; walking off at speed he'd be 80 or 90 units out by then (on the game's own grab
// spots you're creeping along a beam). So his forward speed stops as he steps off: he drops
// straight down beside the edge, which is also what catching yourself looks like.
//
// The search only knows the level's own ground, not objects such as crates and boxes, which the
// game collides with separately. Walking off one of those, the edge is the one he just crossed: the
// last spot he stood on and the first he was in the air are on either side of it. When his hands
// come down to its height and the search found nothing, that edge is handed to the game's hang
// (func_1504CB98 reads the search's results at 0x15050ACC) the way the search would: the edge's
// height, the point he hangs from, and the way he faces (back toward it). The game hangs him where
// the point is, 79 below the top (its own grabs leave him about 14 units past the edge).
//
// One catch per fall: once he has hung, letting go or dropping doesn't catch again until he's back
// on the ground (otherwise letting go took several presses).
