// Adapted for SquirrelPad from ConkerBFDReloaded v1.3.1,
// commit 90a014dbac5019c20a1b7a820ea16a1f0553052f. See LICENSE.txt and THIRD_PARTY_LICENSE.txt.
// From CBFD-Recompiled's mouse camera (Copyright (c) 2026 Sean Ciaschi, MIT License; see
// recomp/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSE). Ours adds the right stick (the General tab's Free Camera
// option): it turns and tilts the same orbit, at up to stick_degrees_per_second.
//
// Free camera: a free orbit camera, called from hooks in recomp/conker.toml.
//
// RecompFrontend's General tab has a Mouse Sensitivity option. Above 0, the cursor is
// captured while the game is played (and released in the menus), and
// recompinput::get_mouse_deltas() gives the mouse's movement since the game last read
// its controllers, scaled by that sensitivity.
//
// The follow camera (struct108: gObjects[0].camera for player 1, D_800DBFF0 the one
// being played) looks at a point (+0x2BC) above its pivot at Conker's feet (+0x2A4),
// from an eye kept at a horizontal distance (+0x374) and height (+0x344) from the
// pivot. It doesn't keep its angle: every frame func_15125330 works it out (+0x37C)
// from where the eye is, and Conker's movement is relative to it. So once the mouse
// moves, the eye the camera wants (+0x2F8) is placed each frame from our own yaw and
// pitch around the look-at point, and the rest of the game follows. The camera stays
// where the mouse leaves it.
//
// Walls: the eye is placed as the game's camera collision (func_1512BB10) starts, the
// way the C-buttons' turning places it earlier in the same update (func_15122C5C). As in the
// HarbourMasters ports' free look, the player's angle is kept and only the distance gives: the
// eye goes as far out along its line from the look-at point as the camera's ball has room
// (ball_room), in at once and back out eased (in the view, func_151284C4). It's placed directly,
// so the game's collision (which slides the camera from last frame's eye and lets it through the
// barn's big posts) has nothing left to move.
//
// The orbit only runs where the C-buttons turn the camera (func_1512D390 ran this
// frame) and not in the look mode (func_15120158: hold R, aiming), so cutscenes, special
// cameras and aiming are the game's. Pressing C-left or C-right
// hands the camera back to the game until the mouse moves again.
